# Memeology - The Science of Memes.

#### You know what happens when the best of teams, works on plans and schemes, using the power of memes, you'll end up with such a masterpiece.. and it's called, Memeology :)


## Who are we:
#### We are Dalal, Salam, Yahya and Mohammed.

## What is Memeology:
#### Memeology is a web app connected to a database which contains loads of urls to pics of the best memes out there. The database is so flex that users have the ability to view & upload memes to it.

## How was it done:
#### Briefly, We all worked together to decide the file structure and the UI, after that we split into 2 pairs which we kept swapping places. Everyone got a chance to work on a piece of the front-end, back-end and the database.

### No more talking, view our app now on [heroku](https://memeology.herokuapp.com/) :D
